# News Intensity API {#theapi}

The FinTxt news intensity API is hosted at <URL>. You can view the endpoints and their documentation at <URL/__swagger__>.

The API contains four endpoints:

  1. **languages**: returns a list of available language for which you can query news intensities
  2. **live**: returns live news intensity metrics for a company or commodity and a language
  3. **historic**: returns historic news intensity metrics for a company or commodity, a language and a date 
  4. **portfolio**: returns live or historic news intensity metrics for a weighted portfolio of stocks or commodities, a language and a date.
  
The *language* endpoint can be queried without an API key. The *historic* endpoint can be queried without an API key for dates that go back beyond 30 days on the date of today.

## Basic usage

View the [documentation](<URL/__swagger__/) for each endpoint for more information about headers and post bodies.

## R and Python clients 

You can use the R and Python 3 clients to retrieve data from the API. These clients can be installed from their GitHub repositories.

### R client 

Install the [R client](https://github.com/FinTxt/FinTxtClient-R) by executing

```r
devtools::install_github("FinTxt/FinTxtClient")
```

After installing the package, register your API token by calling the following code:

```r
library(FinTxtClient)
Sys.setenv("FINTXT_CLIENT_TOKEN" = "<yourtoken>")
```

You can now access the various endpoints:

```r
# Set some variables
identifiers = c("TRI.TO", "IBM.N", "RRD.N", "SPGI.N", "INTU.OQ", "RELN.AS", "WLSNc.AS", "REL.L")
weights = c(0.3, 0.1,0.05,0.05, 0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1)
date = "09-07-2018"
type = "companies"
language = "english"

# Load the client
library(FinTxtClient)

# Call the languages endpoint
langs <- fintxt_get_languages()

# Get the live intensity for a stock
one <- fintxt_live_intensities_one(type = type, language = language, q = identifiers[1])
# Same but for commodity
one <- fintxt_live_intensities_one(type = "commodities", language = language, q = "milk")

# Get historic intensity for a stock
one <- fintxt_historic_intensities_one(type = type, language = language,
                                       date = date, q=identifiers[1])
                                       
# Same but for commodity
one <- fintxt_historic_intensities_one(type = "commodities", language = language,
                                       date = date, q="milk")

# Get live intensity for a portfolio
port <- fintxt_live_intensities_portfolio(type = type,
                                          language = language,
                                          identifiers = c(identifiers, "monkey"),
                                          weights = c(weights, 0.4))
# For commodity
port <- fintxt_live_intensities_portfolio(type = "commodities",
                                          language = language,
                                          identifiers = c("milk", "soybeans"),
                                          weights = c(0.5, 0.5))

# Get historic intensity for a portfolio
port <- fintxt_historic_intensities_portfolio(type = type,
                                          language = language,
                                          date = date,
                                          identifiers = c(identifiers, "monkey"),
                                          weights = c(weights, 0.4))
                                          
# For commodity
port <- fintxt_historic_intensities_portfolio(type = "commodities",
                                              language = language,
                                              date = date,
                                              identifiers = c("milk", "soybeans"),
                                              weights = c(0.5, 0.5))
```

### Python client 

To install the [python client](https://github.com/FinTxt/FinTxtClient-Py), execute the following:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/FinTxt/FinTxtClient-Py.git --user
```

You can import the package as follows:

```python 
from FinTxtClient import FinTxtClient
```

Then, you can initiate the client using:

```python
client = FinTxtClient() # Optionally, pass 'key = <your-key-here>'
```

Using the client is as simple as calling the following functions:


```python
# Call the languages endpoint
client.languages()

# Call the live endpoint for a commodity
client.live_one("commodities", "english", "milk")

# Call the historic endpoint for a commodity and a date
client.historic_one("commodities", "english", "13-07-2018", "milk")

# Call the live portfolio endpoint
client.live_portfolio( _type = "companies", language = "english", 
                      identifiers=["TRI.TO", "IBM.N", "RRD.N", "SPGI.N", "INTU.OQ", "RELN.AS", "WLSNc.AS", "REL.L"], 
                      weights=[0.3, 0.1,0.05,0.05, 0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1])

# Call the historic portfolio endpoint                    
client.historic_portfolio( _type = "companies", language = "english", date="13-07-2018", 
                          identifiers=["TRI.TO", "IBM.N", "RRD.N", "SPGI.N", "INTU.OQ", "RELN.AS", "WLSNc.AS", "REL.L"], 
                          weights=[0.3, 0.1,0.05,0.05, 0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1])
```
